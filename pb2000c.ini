; ----------------------------------------------------

[Settings]
; ----------------------------------------------------
; default is 910 kHz as per HD61700 in the PB-2000C
; but feel free to bring this up to a few Megahertz,
; unit is kilohertz, so 1 MHz = 1000
; ----------------------------------------------------
; OscFreq=910

; ----------------------------------------------------
; this is a byte that identifies the peripheral interface
; and is read from the expansion port addres 0x03,
; (mapped to address 0x0C03), when the device is reset:
; 255 (0xFF) is nothing, 0 is FA-7, 85 (0x55) is MD-100
; Note: setting this takes precedence over 'Interface'
; ----------------------------------------------------
; OptionCode=255

; ----------------------------------------------------
; set to 'MD-100' and uncomment the section below
; if you have an MD-100 emulator running,
; set to 'FA-7' and uncomment the 'Serial' section
; to be able to use the serial port seen as an FA-7
; ----------------------------------------------------
; Interface=None

[Floppy Disk Drive]
; ----------------------------------------------------
; when the below are both set AND Interface is set
; to MD-100 (or OptionCode=85), emulator will attempt
; to connect on this address/port to the MD-100 emulator,
; which will cause the PB-2000C emulator to stutter
; on startup if it cannot connect
; ----------------------------------------------------
; Address=127.0.0.1
; Port=7420

[Serial]
; ----------------------------------------------------
; Listen for serial port connections on the specified
; address and TCP port, Port default is 0 which will
; disable the serial port functionality and ranges
; from 1 to 65535, Listen defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
; for security reasons and can be set to '0.0.0.0'
; to listen on all available interfaces, only a single
; connection can be made and any more are automatically
; closed on connect
; ----------------------------------------------------
