Casio PB-2000C emulator Version 26-WO

This is the source for the enhanced version of Piotr PiÄ…tek's PB-2000C emulator written in / for Borland Delphi 5 and this branch corresponds to Piotr's V26 of the PB-2000C emulator.

PB-2000C is my platform of choice. While some items may or may not end up in either the original PB-2000C emulator or any of the other emulators of related platforms by Piotr, I am  not porting any of this to other Piotr's emulators - you can do this yourself easily enough if you wish.

This repository does NOT contain Casio ROM images required for the emulator to function.

The compiled pb2000c.exe or the contents of the .zip file from the Releases section (including - or not - the .ini file) can be copied into the location where extracted Piotr's emulator resides.

Author's official website is at: http://www.pisi.com.pl/piotr433/pb2000ee.htm

The original source resides in the branch: v26-original.

Main changes:

Usability (keyboard):

- Extensive list of keyboard shortcuts for various keys - keys to be finalised
- Automatic prepending of keys requiring [s] key with [s], meaning you can enter ?!#{}$@ etc. without issues.
- Keys which can be combined with [s] such as arrows, CLS etc., will also have [s] automatically prepended when pressed with Shift. If CLS = F12 then Shift-F12 executes [s] followed shortly by [cls].

Serial port emulation support via TCP:

Fuly working serial port emulation - baud rate and flow control are mostly ignored. Data can be sent and received via a TCP connection, and the state of INT1 masking / unmasking is tracked, so no data is sent to the PB until it opens its serial port. Serial data can also be peeked in both ASCII and hex, recorded to files (TODO), and files can be transmitted to the serial port (TODO). Supported both when emulating the presence of an FA-7 and an MD-100 (OptionCode setting or the new Interface setting). The serial port module operates a 1024-byte queue which is gradually emptied as PB-2000C reads the data. The plan is to implement a 64-kilobyte buffer in combination with the queue, with queue level monitoring that can maintain the queue at configurable certain maximum depth and move data from the buffer to the queue only once the queue is emptied. This will guarantee overrun-free operation at any speed, as long as you don't exceed the 64-kilobyte buffer backlog.

Note: on the host side this isn't a serial port in the sense of a serial port. This is a TCP port where the emulator listens and passes input to the emulated PB-2000C's serial port and passes output to the TCP client. This can be set up as a serial port in your Windows system using any of the available "Virtual COM port" type drivers, although no baud rate negotiation or anything similar is done; it's a straight up TCP pipe. This was developed mostly to assist with the development of the PBNET project: https://github.com/wowczarek/pbnet - but can of course be used by any application you may want to develop, or can be used with the likes of netcat / socat to send files.

New .ini file settings:

```ini
[Settings]
;         Instead of OptionCode = 0, but OptionCode can still be set and takes precedence
;         This will enable the PB-2000C to see RS232C (working) and MT (not working):
;Interface=FA-7

;         Instead of OptionCode = 85, but OptionCode can still be set and takes precedence
;         This will enable the PB-2000C to see RS232C (working) and floppy disk - if connected to the MD-100 emulator:
;Interface=MD-100

; New section
[Serial]
;		  Serial port emulation is enabled if a TCP listen port is set:
; Port=7777
;		  If port is configured, emulator will by default listen on ANY / all addresses (0.0.0.0), but can and should be set to e.g. localhost (127.0.0.1)
; Listen=0.0.0.0

; New section
[Remote]
;		  Remote control is enabled if a TCP listen port is set:
; Port=7778
;		  If port is configured, emulator will by default listen on ANY / all addresses (0.0.0.0), but can and should be set to e.g. localhost (127.0.0.1)
; Listen=0.0.0.0
;		  Key entry interval in milliseconds - this is effectively the key repetition rate and key release runs at half this interval. Minimum 10 ms.
;         Setting the interval too short may result in missed keys. Default is 50 ms which is slow, but works fine.
;		  Note: remote commands and requests (see below) are not timed or queued, but are executed immediately.
; Interval=50
```

Remote control protocol:

A TCP-based remote control protocol was added with a simple but extensive command parser. It is part-ASCII, part-binary, where command entry is exclusively ASCII which makes it possible to comfortably use it via e.g. a raw telnet or netcat session.

Supports:
- direct character entry, including ANSI escape sequences for cursor keys as well as del, esc, tab, bs, meaning that text can be entered without issues
- named key entry in the form of <key> where the keys mostly match what's on the key face of the PB-2000C, such as <menu>, <s>, <cls> - supported for most function keys. The silver keys under the LCD are <m1> ... <m4> and <etc>. Currently not supported are the [memo] and [in/out/calc] keys. This sends keyboard shortcuts to the emulator rather than Casio key codes to the CPU - this will be changed so it's independent from keyboard shortcut mappings (TODO)
- requests, where we ask the emulator for some data or for state, such as <version?>,<power?>,<pause?>, also reading the LCD controller memory through <vmem?>, reading current breakpoint via <bkpt?> (TODO), reading registers via <regs?> (TODO)
- commands with optional parameters, such as <power off!>, <power on!> <power!> (toggle), <pause on!>, <pause off!>, <pause!> (toggle), <getmem [bank, decimal] [start, hex] [len, decimal]!> (TODO), <savemem!> to save memory to disk without exiting the emulator, <bkpt [hex addr]!> <bkpt off!> <bkpt on!> (TODO)
- key entry is buffered and executed in configurable intervals (max queue: 2048 keys), where commands and requests are executed immediately.
- multiple concurrent sessions (up to 8, but this is an arbitrary choice), so multiple clients can execute commands simultaneously, such as one remote LCD viewer and one remote keyboard

This allows e.g. remote scripted demos, or creating alternative keyboard and LCD presentations, let's say a web viewer for the LCD, or if you so wish, a physical LCD or lights in a tower building (hint! someone do this please!). I've written a simple LCD viewer for Linux to demo this, which displays PB2000C's LCD in a console window using Unicode block elements at configurable frame rate - source to be published on GitHub. This protocol will also be the basis for the operation of a headless PB-2000C emulator I am planning to write, which will be (of course) based on Piotr's work, but running in a GUI-free setting.

For now this is being developed in Borland Delphi 5 just like the original, but ideally I want this to eventually be ported to Lazarus, to make this easier for people to build, even though Delphi 5 can easily be had from archive.org or similar these days, but it may require you to run it in a VM because it doesn't play particularly well with Windows 10 and up. Porting to Lazarus is still undecided as after some discussions with Piotr, this has some extra consequences for some emulated platforms and otherwise platforms people run the emulator on.
