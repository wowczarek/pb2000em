version 18, 2010/12/19

- debugger code cleanup in order to make it more portable
- debugger invoked with the key F3 instead of F10, because F10 appears to be
  by default reserved for the system to switch between windows
- fixed a bug in the debbuger (the built-in assember modified the contents
  of the UA register)
- all file names converted to lower case


version 17, 2010/09/29

- added assembler


version 16, 2010/07/31

- corrected BCD arithmetic instructions (for non-BCD operands they
  produced different results than the real device)
- the application priority changed from realtime to normal


version 14, 2008/11/18

- fixed a bug in the debugger (incorrect address in the disassembly
  window after a breakpoint)


version 13, 2008/07/24

- added FDD support over the network
- added extra 32kB RAM in page 2
- changed the way the application form is dragged


version 12, 2008/05/09

- only fixed a bug in the ROM image which influenced some floating point
  functions, e.g. RND, FRAC


version 11, 2008/03/27

- corrected drawing modes in the LCD system
- fixed command 8 of the LCD system (character width in the text mode)


version 10, 2008/03/20

- accurate emulation of the interrupt system
- improved emulation of the LCD controller, more commands supported
- bits 10..12 of the KY register supported

version 08, 2008/02/13

- adjustable CPU clock
- more accurate and configurable ON frequency


version 06, 2008/02/04

- choice between the English/Japanese version based on the absence/presence
  of the KANA key on the Face.bmp image


version 05, 2008/02/03
